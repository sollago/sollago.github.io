I study how people understand sentences—whether they're using their first language or learning a new one. My research focuses on the mental processes behind this, and how these processes vary across different languages and types of learner. Together with my colleagues in the <a target="blank" href=https://www.uni-frankfurt.de/102371493/Romance_Lab>Romance Lab</a>, we focus on languages like Spanish, French, Catalan, Portuguese, and Italian. We use behavioral, eye-tracking, and neurophysiological methods to see what’s going on in the minds of people reading, speaking, or listening to language. We're especially curious about how kids and adults learn Romance languages, and how these languages mix and interact in multilingual environments.
