I investigate how first and second language speakers process sentences in different languages. Together with my colleagues at the <a target="blank" href=https://www.uni-frankfurt.de/102371493/Romance_Lab>Romance Lab</a>, we focus on the acquisition and processing of Romance languages like Spanish, French, Portuguese and Italian. For example, we study how bilingual children learn German together with a Romance language, or how adult German speakers process Romance languages (and viceversa). To address these questions, we conduct comprehension and production experiments using behavioral, eye-tracking and neurophysiological methods.
